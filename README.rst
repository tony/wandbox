jBatch
~~~~~~

jBatch developer, Boris Schaeling says

jBatch_ comes with a ``wandbox`` command to access the API more easily. To compile and run a Python program with Wandbox and append the program's output to a webpage, use:
  
.. code-block:: html

    <script type="text/jbatch">
      wandbox run --compiler python-2.7.3 --code 'print("Hello, world!")' | appendTo body
    </script>
  
See CodePen_ for Wandbox with jBatch in action.
